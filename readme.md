Lince [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arcalab/lince.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arcalab/lince)
========================

This prototype analyses hybrid programs using simulation based on symbolic evaluation (via [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)) and estimation of approximation errors caused by small perturbations.

You can try it online using the link below, or install it on your computer (instructions below).

Lince is developed in Scala, and uses ScalaJS to generate JavaScript.
It is developed as one of the sub-modules of ReoLive (https://github.com/ReoLanguage/ReoLive).


Local installation of Lince
==============
* Requirements:
    - SageMath (http://www.sagemath.org/)
    - SBT (https://www.scala-sbt.org)
    - Java runtime

* Clone the [ReoLive repository](https://github.com/ReoLanguage/ReoLive) (Lince is one of its submodules)

```
git clone git@github.com:ReoLanguage/ReoLive.git
cd ReoLive
```

* Pull the git submodules (which will include Lince):

```
git submodule update --init
```

* Use your favourite editor to edit the path to SageMath executables in:

```
global.properties
```

* Run the compilation script:

```
./compile.sh
```

* During development you can recompile faster using `sbt fastOptJS`.


How to run the framework
=====

* Start the server using `sbt`

```
sbt server/run
``` 

*  Open `localhost:9000` in a browser

```
open http://localhost:9000#lince
```

* Alternatively, open in a browser the local html file `site/lince.html` (or `site/index.html`)

```
open file/lince.html
```
